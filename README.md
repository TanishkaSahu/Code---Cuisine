"Excited to share my latest project, Code Cuisine!

I've created an online menu and bill counter system for 7 Sea Restaurant using C programming language. This project allows customers to:

Order dishes from a variety of options
View their orders in real-time
Generate a bill at the end of their meal

Features include:

User-friendly interface
Easy ordering process
Accurate bill calculation
Real-time order tracking

Code Cuisine demonstrates my skills in C programming, problem-solving, and software development.
